# California-Wildfire-Event-Prediction
Every year, the California Wildfire is one of the biggest issues that the state is suffering from. It could help to prevent the expansion of wildfire if the event can be predicted in advance. Weather condition is one of the well-acknowledged variable that people believe which correlates with the wildfire events, and our team has received a request to understand how can the weather implement to help understand the wildfire, and as the weather prediction are becoming more accurate in the future, we have made an hypothesis on whether the weather data can make predictions on the wildfire event in California and the performance of the model. The datasets, including data of California weather stations and California recorded wildfire events, are obtained from a research team, and the goal for the project is to apply exploratory and predictive data analysis approach to understand how the weather data can help to predict the California Wildfires. Spatial analysis, data visualization, linear modeling and machine learning are implemented in this study.
